#Alphanumeric

Alphanumeric are easy homemade encryption & decryption algorithms with Go. These work really simple and are part of me
self teaching myself the Go programming language.

Alphanumeric simply translates a letter to the number of its position in the alphabet (= encryption) and back (=decryption). Only characters from A-Z are supported, others will be translated to '0' in the encryption or '?' in the decryption.  

How can I run it?
