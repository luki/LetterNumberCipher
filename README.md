暗証化 (あんしょうか) - Anshōka: encryption; coding; password

Some time ago, I have sent a cryptic message to my girlfriend. She got the trick behind it really quickly, still do we sometimes use it out of fun.

Passed in letters will be translated to their position in the alphabet, meaning this tool does support just A-Z, but also German umlauts like 'Ä', 'Ö' and 'Ü', whill be translated to 'ae', 'oe' and 'ue,', 
and even 'ß', which will be translated to 'ss', which was possible in old German. Characters like 'ō' & ū from Romaji (Japanese with latin characters), are not supported yet.

Unkown characters will be translated to '0', since there is no letter '0'. In the translation back to original, 0 will be translated to '?'.  

How can I run it?
=================

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) on your computer
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/miyohiki/alphanumeric.git`
3. Select the local repository: `cd alphanumeric`
4. Run a program: `go run encryption.go'`
